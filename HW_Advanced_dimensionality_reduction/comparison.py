# 1. Comparing linear and non-linear DR (4 points)
#    Compare PCA and t-SNE methods by visualizing Bike Sharing Rental dataset.
#    Explore how the different features are shown in the DR components. Build a simple prediction model (for example, MLP or Random Forest)
#    to predict the count of total rental bikes and compare the performance of the model with the different DR techniques.
